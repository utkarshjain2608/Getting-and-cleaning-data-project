Getting-and-cleaning-data-project
=================================

contains the project of coursera project

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': List of class labels and their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'train/subject_train.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

'test/subject_test.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data

First it checks to see if the required "reshape2" has been installed and then loads the "reshape2" package.

It then reads all required .txt files and labels the datasets

Consquently the appropriate "activity_id"'s and "subject_id"'s are appended to the "test" and the "training" data, which are then combined into one single data frame

Using the "grep" function, all the columns with mean() and std() values are extracted and then a new data frame, including only the "activity_id", the "subject_id" and the mean() and std() columns, is created

Using the "merge" function, descriptive activity names are merged with the mean/std values dataset, to get one dataset with descriptive activity names

Lastly, with the help of the "melt" and "dcast" functions of the "reshape2" package, the data is converted into a table containing mean values of all the included features, ordered by the activity name and the subject id, and the data is written to the "tidy_movement_data.txt" file.
